I am currently a PhD student in Transportation Planning and Management at the [School of Transportation Engineering, Chang'an University](https://ysxy.chd.edu.cn/). My supervisors are [Professor Zhang Chi](https://js.chd.edu.cn/glxy/zc/) and [Associate Professor Zhang Min](https://js.chd.edu.cn/ysgcxy/zm/). I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering from Changsha University of Science and Technology in June 2022 (under the guidance of [Lecturer Li Shun](https://www.csust.edu.cn/jtysgcxy/info/1130/17459.htm), and pursued a Master's degree in Transportation Engineering at Chang'an University in September 2022. I started pursuing a doctoral degree in 2024.

My research interests include road traffic safety, traffic big data analysis and application technologies, such as evaluating the geometric design of roads and using trajectory data to identify road risk sections.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
